# Ultra SEO Pro Guide for renderman.ai

This guide outlines the strategy to make `renderman.ai` dominate search results in the architectural AI niche.

## 1. Image Naming Strategy (Crucial)
Search engines (Google Images) are a massive source of traffic for visual tools. **Never upload files like `image1.jpg` or `screenshot.png`.**

**Formula:** `[project-type]-[style]-[action]-ai-render.jpg`

**Examples:**
*   **Bad:** `house.jpg`, `render_final.png`
*   **Good:** `modern-villa-sketch-to-photorealistic-render.jpg`
*   **Good:** `scandinavian-interior-ai-visualization.jpg`
*   **Good:** `site-plan-to-3d-isometric-diagram.jpg`

**Why?** When someone searches "sketch to render modern villa", Google looks at the filename first.

## 2. Gallery Descriptions
When adding images to `gallery-data.json`, ensure the `prompt` and `category` fields are rich with keywords.

*   **Prompt:** Don't just say "House". Say "Modern sustainable villa with timber facade, evening lighting, photorealistic architectural visualization."
*   **Style:** Use terms people search for: "Photorealistic", "Watercolor", "Sketch", "Blueprint".

## 3. Backlink Strategy (Off-Page SEO)
To dominate, you need other reputable sites linking to you.
*   **Architectural Forums:** Post your best before/after results on Reddit (r/architecture, r/rendering), ArchDaily forums, etc.
*   **Social Media:** Always link back to `https://renderman.ai` in your bio and posts. Use tags like `#AIarchitecture #rendering #archviz`.
*   **YouTube:** Create short "How to" videos showing the tool in action. YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine.

## 4. Technical SEO (Already Implemented)
I have handled the technical side for you:
*   **Meta Tags:** `index.html` now has "AI architecture", "sketch to render", and other high-value keywords.
*   **Sitemap:** `sitemap.xml` is live to help Google crawl your site daily.
*   **Robots.txt:** Instructions for crawlers are set.
*   **Performance:** The site is built with Vite/React for speed (Core Web Vitals).

## 5. Future Content Expansion
To truly lead, consider adding a **Blog** section later.
*   Write articles like: "Top 5 AI Tools for Architects in 2025", "How to Convert Sketches to Renders Instantly".
*   These articles capture long-tail search traffic.
